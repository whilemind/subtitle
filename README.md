2. separate voice *.wav file from *.mp4.
3. separate the background music and voice into two different file from *.wav file.
4. slice the *.wav voice file by detecting silence.
5. now use the google vocie to text engine to translate sliced voice file to text file.

We will need a movie *.mp4 file which subtitle will be generated automatically. At first the sound file need to be seperated from the video file for that we will use the following command:
